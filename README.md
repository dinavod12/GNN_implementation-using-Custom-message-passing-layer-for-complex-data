# GNN_implementation-using-Custom-message-passing-layer-and-classifier--for-complex-data
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep learning model designed to operate on graph-structured data.Here I implement the Link Prediction for complex data using custom message passing layers and classifier which include node_feature as well edge_feature. I include both node feature as well edge feature for link prediction.
